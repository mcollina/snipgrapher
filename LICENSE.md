## Verification of per-theme notices

Checked Carbon sources used for this port:

- `lib/constants.js` (theme IDs and colors)
- `public/static/themes/*.min.css` (night-owl, nord, one-dark, one-light, synthwave-84, verminal)

No explicit per-theme copyright/credit headers were found in those files.
If upstream adds theme-specific notices later, this file should be updated.
